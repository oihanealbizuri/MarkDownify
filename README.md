# MarkDownify

This project is a web application that allows users to convert Markdown-style text to formatted text and view the output in real-time. It uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to create a user-friendly interface that supports various markdown elements such as headings and lists.

## Features

- Convert Markdown to formatted text in real-time
- Supports various markdown elements like headings and lists
- User-friendly interface with input and output areas
- Synchronized scrolling between the input textarea and output div

```

4. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.


## How to Use

1. Enter your Markdown-style text in the input textarea on the left side of the page.

2. As you type or scroll inside the input textarea, the formatted output will be displayed on the right side of the page.
